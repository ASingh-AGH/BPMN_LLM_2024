## Prompt 

    I want you to create a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) model for the process described below. Return the model in the following format: task nodes as words, parallel gateways as 
    AND, exclusive gateways as XOR, and arcs as>. You should number the gateways. You may also label the outgoing arcs of an exclusive gateway to denote the decision criterion, like XOR 
    Gateway-> (condition 1) Task. Additionally, provide a mapping of actors to activities, in the format actor: [activity1, ...]

    A good example of formatting:
    Start Event O -> Task [Describe Task]
    Task [Describe Task] -> XOR Gateway 1
    XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (Describe Condition 1)
    XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (Describe Condition 2)
    Condition (Describe Condition 1) -> Task [Describe Task]
    Condition (Describe Condition 2) -> Event End O

    Process description: A small company manufactures customized bicycles. Whenever the sales department receives an order, a new process instance is created. A member of the sales 
    department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike. In the former case, the process instance is nished. In the latter case, the storehouse and the engineering department are 
    informed. The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part. If the part is available in- hause, it is reserved. If it is not available, it is 
    back-ordered. This procedure is repeated for each item on the part list. In the meantime, the engineering department prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle. If the 
    storehouse successfully reserved or back-ordered every item of the part list and the preparation activity has nished, the engineering department assembles the bicycle. Afterwards, the sales 
    department ships the bicycle to the customer and nishes the process instance

## Response
### BPMN Model for Customized Bicycle Manufacturing

**Start Event O -> Task [Receive Order]** (Sales Department)

**Task [Receive Order]** -> **Exclusive Gateway 1**

**Exclusive Gateway 1** -> **(Rejected)** Task [Reject Order] (Sales Department) -> **Event End O**

**Exclusive Gateway 1** -> **(Accepted)** Task [Inform Storehouse and Engineering] (Sales Department)

**Task [Inform Storehouse and Engineering]** -> **Parallel Gateway 2**

**Parallel Gateway 2** -> Task [Process Part List] (Storehouse)

**Task [Process Part List]** -> **Exclusive Gateway 3**

**Exclusive Gateway 3** -> **(In Stock)** Task [Reserve Part] (Storehouse) -> **Loop Gateway 4**

**Exclusive Gateway 3** -> **(Out of Stock)** Task [Back-order Part] (Storehouse) -> **Loop Gateway 4**

**Loop Gateway 4** -> **(More Parts?)** XOR Gateway 5

**XOR Gateway 5** -> **(No)** Task [Parts Ready] (Storehouse)

**XOR Gateway 5** -> **(Yes)** Task [Process Part List] (Storehouse) -> **Loop Gateway 4**

**Parallel Gateway 2** -> Task [Prepare for Assembly] (Engineering)

**Task [Parts Ready] (Storehouse)** -> **Synchronize Gateway 6**

**Task [Prepare for Assembly] (Engineering)** -> **Synchronize Gateway 6**

**Synchronize Gateway 6** -> **(Both Ready)** Task [Assemble Bicycle] (Engineering)

**Task [Assemble Bicycle] (Engineering)** -> Task [Ship to Customer] (Sales Department) -> **Event End O**

**Actor Mapping:**

* Sales Department: [Receive Order, Reject Order, Inform Storehouse and Engineering, Ship to Customer]
* Storehouse: [Process Part List, Reserve Part, Back-order Part, Parts Ready]
* Engineering: [Prepare for Assembly, Assemble Bicycle]
