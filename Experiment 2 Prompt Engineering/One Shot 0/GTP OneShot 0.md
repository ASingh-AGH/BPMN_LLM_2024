## Prompt 

    I want you to create a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) model for the process described below. Return the model in the following format: task nodes as words, parallel gateways as 
    AND, exclusive gateways as XOR, and arcs as>. You should number the gateways. You may also label the outgoing arcs of an exclusive gateway to denote the decision criterion, like XOR 
    Gateway-> (condition 1) Task. Additionally, provide a mapping of actors to activities, in the format actor: [activity1, ...]

    A good example of formatting:
    Start Event O -> Task [Describe Task]
    Task [Describe Task] -> XOR Gateway 1
    XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (Describe Condition 1)
    XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (Describe Condition 2)
    Condition (Describe Condition 1) -> Task [Describe Task]
    Condition (Describe Condition 2) -> Event End O

    Process description: A small company manufactures customized bicycles. Whenever the sales department receives an order, a new process instance is created. A member of the sales 
    department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike. In the former case, the process instance is finished. In the latter case, the storehouse and the engineering department are 
    informed. The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part. If the part is available in-house, it is reserved. If it is not available, it is 
    back-ordered. This procedure is repeated for each item on the part list. In the meantime, the engineering department prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle. If the 
    storehouse successfully reserved or back-ordered every item of the part list and the preparation activity has finished, the engineering department assembles the bicycle. Afterwards, the sales 
    department ships the bicycle to the customer and nishes the process instance

## Response
Start Event O -> Sales Department Review
Sales Department Review -> XOR Gateway 1
XOR Gateway 1 -> Reject Order
XOR Gateway 1 -> Accept Order
Reject Order -> End Event
Accept Order -> Storehouse and Engineering Department Notification
Storehouse and Engineering Department Notification -> AND Gateway 2
AND Gateway 2 -> Part List Processing
AND Gateway 2 -> Engineering Preparation
Part List Processing -> XOR Gateway 3
XOR Gateway 3 -> Part Available (Reserve)
XOR Gateway 3 -> Part Not Available (Back-order)
Part Available (Reserve) -> Part List Processing
Part Not Available (Back-order) -> Part List Processing
Engineering Preparation -> Bicycle Assembly
Bicycle Assembly -> Sales Department Shipping
Sales Department Shipping -> End Event

Actor mapping:
- Sales Department: [Sales Department Review, Reject Order, Accept Order, Storehouse and Engineering Department Notification, Sales Department Shipping]
- Storehouse: [Part List Processing]
- Engineering Department: [Engineering Preparation, Bicycle Assembly]
