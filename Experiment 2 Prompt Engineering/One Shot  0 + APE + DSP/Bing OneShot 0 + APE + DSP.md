## Prompt 

    I want you to create a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) model for the process described below. Return the model in the following format: task nodes as Task [words], parallel gateways as AND, exclusive gateways as XOR, and arcs as ->.
    You should number the gateways. 
    You may also label the outgoing arcs of an exclusive gateway to denote the decision criterion, like XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (action choice). 
    Additionally, provide a mapping of actors to activities, in the format Actor: [activity1, ...]

    Process description: A small company manufactures customized bicycles. Whenever the sales department receives an order, a new process instance is created. A member of the sales  department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike. In the former case, the process instance is nished. In the latter case, the storehouse and the engineering department are informed. The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part. If the part is available in- hause, it is reserved. If it is not available, it is back-ordered. This procedure is repeated for each item on the part list. In the meantime, the engineering department prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle. If the storehouse successfully reserved or back-ordered every item of the part list and the preparation activity has nished, the engineering department assembles the bicycle. Afterwards, the sales department ships the bicycle to the customer and nishes the process instance

    Hint: A good example of formatting is as follows,
    Start Event O -> Task [Describe Task]
    Task [Describe Task] -> XOR Gateway 1
    XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (Describe Condition 1)
    XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (Describe Condition 2)
    Condition (Describe Condition 1) -> Task [Describe Task]
    Condition (Describe Condition 2) -> Event End O
    Letâ€™s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer.

## Response
Sure, let's break down the process step by step:

1. The sales department receives an order and a new process instance is created.
2. A member of the sales department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike.
3. If the order is rejected, the process instance is finished.
4. If the order is accepted, the storehouse and the engineering department are informed.
5. The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part.
6. If the part is available in-house, it is reserved. If it is not available, it is back-ordered. This procedure is repeated for each item on the part list.
7. In the meantime, the engineering department prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle.
8. If the storehouse successfully reserved or back-ordered every item of the part list and the preparation activity has finished, the engineering department assembles the bicycle.
9. Afterwards, the sales department ships the bicycle to the customer and finishes the process instance.

Now, let's represent this process in the BPMN model:

```
Start Event O -> Task [Receive Order]
Task [Receive Order] -> XOR Gateway 1
XOR Gateway 1 -> (Order Rejected) Event End O
XOR Gateway 1 -> (Order Accepted) Task [Inform Storehouse and Engineering]
Task [Inform Storehouse and Engineering] -> AND Gateway 1
AND Gateway 1 -> Task [Process Part List]
Task [Process Part List] -> XOR Gateway 2
XOR Gateway 2 -> (Part Available) Task [Reserve Part]
XOR Gateway 2 -> (Part Not Available) Task [Back-order Part]
Task [Reserve Part] -> AND Gateway 2
Task [Back-order Part] -> AND Gateway 2
AND Gateway 1 -> Task [Prepare for Assembly]
Task [Prepare for Assembly] -> AND Gateway 2
AND Gateway 2 -> Task [Assemble Bicycle]
Task [Assemble Bicycle] -> Task [Ship Bicycle]
Task [Ship Bicycle] -> Event End O
```

And here is the mapping of actors to activities:

```
Sales Department: [Receive Order, Ship Bicycle]
Storehouse: [Process Part List, Reserve Part, Back-order Part]
Engineering Department: [Prepare for Assembly, Assemble Bicycle]
```
