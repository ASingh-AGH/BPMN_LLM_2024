## Prompt 

    I want you to create a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) model for the process described below. Return the model in the following format: task nodes as Task [words], parallel gateways as AND, exclusive gateways as XOR, and arcs as ->.
    You should number the gateways. 
    You may also label the outgoing arcs of an exclusive gateway to denote the decision criterion, like XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (action choice). 
    Additionally, provide a mapping of actors to activities, in the format Actor: [activity1, ...]

    Process description: A small company manufactures customized bicycles. Whenever the sales department receives an order, a new process instance is created. A member of the sales  department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike. In the former case, the process instance is finished. In the latter case, the storehouse and the engineering department are informed. The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part. If the part is available in-house, it is reserved. If it is not available, it is back-ordered. This procedure is repeated for each item on the part list. In the meantime, the engineering department prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle. If the storehouse successfully reserved or back-ordered every item of the part list and the preparation activity has finished, the engineering department assembles the bicycle. Afterwards, the sales department ships the bicycle to the customer and nishes the process instance

    Hint: A good example of formatting is as follows,
    Start Event O -> Task [Describe Task]
    Task [Describe Task] -> XOR Gateway 1
    XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (Describe Condition 1)
    XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (Describe Condition 2)
    Condition (Describe Condition 1) -> Task [Describe Task]
    Condition (Describe Condition 2) -> Event End O
    Letâ€™s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer.

## Response
Alright, let's break down the process step by step:

1. Start Event O -> Sales Department receives order
2. Sales Department receives order -> XOR Gateway 1
   - XOR Gateway 1 -> Accept Order
   - XOR Gateway 1 -> Reject Order
3. Accept Order -> AND Gateway 2
   - AND Gateway 2 -> Storehouse
   - AND Gateway 2 -> Engineering Department
4. Storehouse -> XOR Gateway 3
   - XOR Gateway 3 -> Part available in-house
   - XOR Gateway 3 -> Part not available
5. Part available in-house -> Reserve Part
6. Reserve Part -> XOR Gateway 4
   - XOR Gateway 4 -> All parts reserved
   - XOR Gateway 4 -> Part not reserved
7. All parts reserved -> Engineering Department
8. Part not available -> Back-order Part
9. Back-order Part -> XOR Gateway 5
   - XOR Gateway 5 -> All parts back-ordered
   - XOR Gateway 5 -> Part not back-ordered
10. All parts back-ordered -> Engineering Department
11. Engineering Department -> Assemble Bicycle
12. Assemble Bicycle -> Sales Department
13. Sales Department -> Ship Bicycle
14. Ship Bicycle -> End Event O

Now, let's put this into BPMN notation:

- Start Event O
- Task [Sales Department receives order] -> XOR Gateway 1
- XOR Gateway 1 (1)
  - Accept Order -> AND Gateway 2
  - Reject Order
- AND Gateway 2 (2)
  - Storehouse
  - Engineering Department
- Storehouse -> XOR Gateway 3
- XOR Gateway 3 (3)
  - Part available in-house -> Reserve Part
  - Part not available -> Back-order Part
- Reserve Part -> XOR Gateway 4
- XOR Gateway 4 (4)
  - All parts reserved -> Engineering Department
  - Part not reserved
- Back-order Part -> XOR Gateway 5
- XOR Gateway 5 (5)
  - All parts back-ordered -> Engineering Department
  - Part not back-ordered
- Engineering Department -> Assemble Bicycle -> Sales Department -> Ship Bicycle -> End Event O

Mapping of actors to activities:
- Sales Department: [Sales Department receives order, Accept Order, Reject Order, Ship Bicycle]
- Storehouse: [Part available in-house, Part not available, All parts reserved, Part not reserved, All parts back-ordered, Part not back-ordered]
- Engineering Department: [Engineering Department, Assemble Bicycle]
