## Prompt 

    I want you to create a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) model for the process described below. Hint: 
    Return the model in the following format: task nodes as Task [words], parallel gateways as AND, exclusive gateways as XOR, and arcs as ->.
    You should number the gateways. 
    You may also label the outgoing arcs of an exclusive gateway to denote the decision criterion, like XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (action choice). 
    Additionally, provide a mapping of actors to activities, in the format Actor: [activity1, ...]

    Process description: A small company manufactures customized bicycles. Whenever the sales department receives an order, a new process instance is created. A member of the sales  department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike. In the former case, the process instance is finished. In the latter case, the storehouse and the engineering department are informed. The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part. If the part is available in-house, it is reserved. If it is not available, it is back-ordered. This procedure is repeated for each item on the part list. In the meantime, the engineering department prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle. If the storehouse successfully reserved or back-ordered every item of the part list and the preparation activity has finished, the engineering department assembles the bicycle. Afterwards, the sales department ships the bicycle to the customer and nishes the process instance


## Response
Sure, here's the BPMN model for the described process:

```plaintext
Sales Department -> Task [Receive Order] -> XOR Gateway 1
XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (Reject Order) -> Task [End Process]
XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (Accept Order) -> AND Gateway 2
AND Gateway 2 -> Task [Inform Storehouse] -> Task [Inform Engineering Department]
AND Gateway 2 -> Task [Inform Engineering Department] -> Task [Process Part List]
Task [Process Part List] -> XOR Gateway 3
XOR Gateway 3 -> Condition (Part Available) -> Task [Reserve Part]
XOR Gateway 3 -> Condition (Part Not Available) -> Task [Back-Order Part]
Task [Reserve Part] -> XOR Gateway 4
XOR Gateway 4 -> Condition (More Parts to Process) -> Task [Process Part List]
XOR Gateway 4 -> Condition (All Parts Processed) -> Task [Prepare for Assembly]
Task [Back-Order Part] -> XOR Gateway 5
XOR Gateway 5 -> Condition (More Parts to Process) -> Task [Process Part List]
XOR Gateway 5 -> Condition (All Parts Processed) -> Task [Prepare for Assembly]
Task [Prepare for Assembly] -> XOR Gateway 6
XOR Gateway 6 -> Condition (Storehouse Ready & Preparation Done) -> Task [Assemble Bicycle]
XOR Gateway 6 -> Condition (Not Ready) -> Task [Wait for Completion]
Task [Assemble Bicycle] -> Task [Ship Bicycle] -> Task [End Process]
Task [Wait for Completion] -> Task [Prepare for Assembly]
```

Mapping of actors to activities:
- Sales Department: Receive Order, Inform Storehouse, Inform Engineering Department, Ship Bicycle
- Storehouse: Process Part List, Reserve Part, Back-Order Part
- Engineering Department: Prepare for Assembly, Assemble Bicycle
