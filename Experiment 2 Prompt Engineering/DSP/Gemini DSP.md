## Prompt 

    I want you to create a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) model for the process described below. Hint: 
    Return the model in the following format: task nodes as Task [words], parallel gateways as AND, exclusive gateways as XOR, and arcs as ->.
    You should number the gateways. 
    You may also label the outgoing arcs of an exclusive gateway to denote the decision criterion, like XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (action choice). 
    Additionally, provide a mapping of actors to activities, in the format Actor: [activity1, ...]

    Process description: A small company manufactures customized bicycles. Whenever the sales department receives an order, a new process instance is created. A member of the sales  department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike. In the former case, the process instance is nished. In the latter case, the storehouse and the engineering department are informed. The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part. If the part is available in- hause, it is reserved. If it is not available, it is back-ordered. This procedure is repeated for each item on the part list. In the meantime, the engineering department prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle. If the storehouse successfully reserved or back-ordered every item of the part list and the preparation activity has nished, the engineering department assembles the bicycle. Afterwards, the sales department ships the bicycle to the customer and nishes the process instance



## Response

### BPMN Model for Customized Bicycle Manufacturing

**Task Nodes:**

* Task 1: Receive Order
* Task 2: Reject Order
* Task 3: Accept Order
* Task 4: Inform Storehouse
* Task 5: Inform Engineering
* Task 6: Process Part List
* Task 7: Check Part Availability
* Task 8: Reserve Part (if available)
* Task 9: Backorder Part (if not available)
* Task 10: Prepare for Assembly
* Task 11: Assemble Bicycle
* Task 12: Ship Bicycle

**Gateways:**

* XOR Gateway 1: Accept/Reject Order
* XOR Gateway 2: Part Available/Unavailable

**Arcs:**

* Start Event -> Task 1 (Receive Order)
* Task 1 -> XOR Gateway 1 (Accept/Reject Order)
* XOR Gateway 1 -> Task 2 (Reject Order) (End Event implied)
* XOR Gateway 1 -> Task 3 (Accept Order)
* Task 3 -> Task 4 (Inform Storehouse)
* Task 3 -> Task 5 (Inform Engineering)
* Task 4 -> Task 6 (Process Part List)
* Task 5 -> Task 10 (Prepare for Assembly)
* Task 6 -> Task 7 (Check Part Availability)
* Task 7 -> XOR Gateway 2 (Part Available/Unavailable)
* XOR Gateway 2 -> Task 8 (Reserve Part) (Yes)
* XOR Gateway 2 -> Task 9 (Backorder Part) (No)
* Task 8 -> Loop Start (repeat for each part in list)
* Task 9 -> Loop Start (repeat for each part in list)
* Loop End -> (Connects back to Task 6 after all parts processed)
* Task 10 -> (Synchronizes with part processing loop)
* XOR Gateway 3 (implicit): All Parts Reserved/Backordered & Preparation Finished -> Task 11 (Assemble Bicycle)
* Task 11 -> Task 12 (Ship Bicycle)
* Task 12 -> End Event

**Actor Mapping:**

* Sales Department: Task 1, Task 2, Task 3
* Storehouse: Task 4, Task 6, Task 7, Task 8, Task 9
* Engineering Department: Task 5, Task 10, Task 11
