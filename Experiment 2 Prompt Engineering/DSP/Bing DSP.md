## Prompt 

    I want you to create a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) model for the process described below. Hint: 
    Return the model in the following format: task nodes as Task [words], parallel gateways as AND, exclusive gateways as XOR, and arcs as ->.
    You should number the gateways. 
    You may also label the outgoing arcs of an exclusive gateway to denote the decision criterion, like XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (action choice). 
    Additionally, provide a mapping of actors to activities, in the format Actor: [activity1, ...]

    Process description: A small company manufactures customized bicycles. Whenever the sales department receives an order, a new process instance is created. A member of the sales  department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike. In the former case, the process instance is nished. In the latter case, the storehouse and the engineering department are informed. The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part. If the part is available in- hause, it is reserved. If it is not available, it is back-ordered. This procedure is repeated for each item on the part list. In the meantime, the engineering department prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle. If the storehouse successfully reserved or back-ordered every item of the part list and the preparation activity has nished, the engineering department assembles the bicycle. Afterwards, the sales department ships the bicycle to the customer and nishes the process instance


## Response
Here is the BPMN model for the process:

```
Start -> Task [Sales department receives an order] -> XOR Gateway 1
XOR Gateway 1 -> Reject (Order is rejected) -> End
XOR Gateway 1 -> Accept (Order is accepted) -> AND Gateway 1
AND Gateway 1 -> Task [Storehouse processes part list] -> XOR Gateway 2
XOR Gateway 2 -> Available (Part is available) -> Task [Part is reserved] -> XOR Gateway 2
XOR Gateway 2 -> Not Available (Part is not available) -> Task [Part is back-ordered] -> XOR Gateway 2
XOR Gateway 2 -> Done (All parts processed) -> AND Gateway 2
AND Gateway 1 -> Task [Engineering department prepares for assembly] -> AND Gateway 2
AND Gateway 2 -> Task [Engineering department assembles bicycle] -> Task [Sales department ships bicycle] -> End
```

And here is the mapping of actors to activities:

- Sales Department: [Receives an order, Rejects or accepts the order, Ships bicycle]
- Storehouse: [Processes part list, Reserves part, Back-orders part]
- Engineering Department: [Prepares for assembly, Assembles bicycle]
