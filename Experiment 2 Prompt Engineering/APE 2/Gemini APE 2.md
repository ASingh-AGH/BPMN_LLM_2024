# Gemini APE 2

## Prompt 

    I want you to create a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) model for the process described below. Return the model in the following format: task nodes as Task [words], parallel gateways as AND, exclusive gateways as XOR, and arcs as ->.
    You should number the gateways. 
    You may also label the outgoing arcs of an exclusive gateway to denote the decision criterion, like XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (action choice). 
    Additionally, provide a mapping of actors to activities, in the format Actor: [activity1, ...]

    Process description: A small company manufactures customized bicycles. Whenever the sales department receives an order, a new process instance is created. A member of the sales  department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike. In the former case, the process instance is finished. In the latter case, the storehouse and the engineering department are informed. The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part. If the part is available in-house, it is reserved. If it is not available, it is back-ordered. This procedure is repeated for each item on the part list. In the meantime, the engineering department prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle. If the storehouse successfully reserved or back-ordered every item of the part list and the preparation activity has finished, the engineering department assembles the bicycle. Afterwards, the sales department ships the bicycle to the customer and nishes the process instance

    Letâ€™s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Firstly, think logically for a well-defined workflow, avoiding common modeling issues like deadlocks and unconnected broken flows.


## Response

### BPMN Model for Customized Bicycle Manufacturing

**Task Nodes:**

* Task 1: Receive Order (Sales)
* Task 2: Reject Order (Sales)
* Task 3: Accept Order (Sales)
* Task 4: Inform Storehouse (Sales)
* Task 5: Inform Engineering (Sales)
* Task 6: Process Part List (Storehouse)
* Task 7: Check Part Availability (Storehouse)
* Task 8: Reserve Part (Storehouse)
* Task 9: Back-Order Part (Storehouse) (repeat for each part)
* Task 10: Prepare Assembly (Engineering)
* Task 11: Assemble Bicycle (Engineering)
* Task 12: Ship Bicycle (Sales)

**Gateways:**

* XOR Gateway 1: Order Accepted? (Yes/No)
* AND Gateway 2: Parts Reserved/Back-ordered & Assembly Prepared?

**Arcs:**

* Start -> Task 1
* Task 1 -> XOR Gateway 1
* XOR Gateway 1 (Yes) -> Task 3
* XOR Gateway 1 (No) -> Task 2
* Task 2 -> End
* Task 3 -> Task 4
* Task 3 -> Task 5
* Task 4 -> Task 6
* Task 5 -> Task 10
* Task 6 -> Task 7
* Task 7 -> XOR Gateway 2 (Yes) -> Task 8
* Task 7 -> XOR Gateway 2 (No) -> Task 9
* Task 8 -> Repeat (Task 6) (until all parts processed)
* Task 9 -> Repeat (Task 6) (until all parts processed)
* End of Repeat -> AND Gateway 2
* Task 10 -> AND Gateway 2
* AND Gateway 2 -> Task 11
* Task 11 -> Task 12
* Task 12 -> End

**Actor Mapping:**

* Sales: Task 1, Task 2, Task 3, Task 4, Task 5, Task 12
* Storehouse: Task 6, Task 7, Task 8, Task 9
* Engineering: Task 10, Task 11

This model avoids deadlocks and disconnected flows by ensuring all paths lead to an end event. The loops for part processing are represented by a repeat structure with a clear termination condition (all parts processed).
