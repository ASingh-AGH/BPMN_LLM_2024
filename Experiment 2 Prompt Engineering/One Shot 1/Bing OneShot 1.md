## Prompt 

    I want you to create a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) model for the process described below. Return the model in the following format: task nodes as words, parallel gateways as 
    AND, exclusive gateways as XOR, and arcs as>. You should number the gateways. You may also label the outgoing arcs of an exclusive gateway to denote the decision criterion, like XOR 
    Gateway-> (condition 1) Task. Additionally, provide a mapping of actors to activities, in the format actor: [activity1, ...]

    A good example of formatting:
    Order Received-> XOR Gateway 1
    XOR Gateway 1-> (Order Rejected) End Event
    XOR Gateway 1-> (Order Accepted) AND Gateway 1
    AND Gateway 1-> Process Part List
    AND Gateway 1-> Prepare for Assembling

    Process description: A small company manufactures customized bicycles. Whenever the sales department receives an order, a new process instance is created. A member of the sales 
    department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike. In the former case, the process instance is finished. In the latter case, the storehouse and the engineering department are 
    informed. The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part. If the part is available in-house, it is reserved. If it is not available, it is 
    back-ordered. This procedure is repeated for each item on the part list. In the meantime, the engineering department prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle. If the 
    storehouse successfully reserved or back-ordered every item of the part list and the preparation activity has finished, the engineering department assembles the bicycle. Afterwards, the sales 
    department ships the bicycle to the customer and nishes the process instance

## Response
Certainly! Here’s the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) model for the described process:
1. Order Received -> XOR Gateway 1
2. XOR Gateway 1 -> (Order Rejected) End Event
3. XOR Gateway 1 -> (Order Accepted) AND Gateway 1
4. AND Gateway 1 -> Process Part List
5. Process Part List -> AND Gateway 2
6. AND Gateway 2 -> Reserve Part (if available)
7. Reserve Part (if available) -> XOR Gateway 2
8. XOR Gateway 2 -> (Part Reserved) AND Gateway 1
9. XOR Gateway 2 -> (Part Back-Ordered) AND Gateway 1
10. Part Reserved -> AND Gateway 1
11. Part Back-Ordered -> AND Gateway 1
12. AND Gateway 1 -> Prepare for Assembling
13. Prepare for Assembling -> Task: Assemble Bicycle
14. Task: Assemble Bicycle -> Task: Ship to Customer
15. Task: Ship to Customer -> End Event

Actor-Activity Mapping:
- Sales Department: [Order Received]
- Storehouse: [Process Part List, Reserve Part (if available), Back-Order Part (if not available)]
- Engineering Department: [Prepare for Assembling, Assemble Bicycle, Ship to Customer]
