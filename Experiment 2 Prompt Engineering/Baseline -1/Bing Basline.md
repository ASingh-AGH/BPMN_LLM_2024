## Prompt 

    I want you to create a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) model for the process described below. 

    Process description: A small company manufactures customized bicycles. Whenever the sales department receives an order, a new process instance is created. A member of the sales 
    department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike. In the former case, the process instance is nished. In the latter case, the storehouse and the engineering department are 
    informed. The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part. If the part is available in- hause, it is reserved. If it is not available, it is 
    back-ordered. This procedure is repeated for each item on the part list. In the meantime, the engineering department prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle. If the 
    storehouse successfully reserved or back-ordered every item of the part list and the preparation activity has nished, the engineering department assembles the bicycle. Afterwards, the sales 
    department ships the bicycle to the customer and nishes the process instance

## Response
Here's a textual representation of the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) for the described process:

```
Start
|
v
Sales Department Receives Order
|
v
Decision: Accept or Reject Order
|
|--> If Order Rejected: End Process
|
v
If Order Accepted: Inform Storehouse and Engineering Department
|
v
Storehouse Processes Part List
|
v
For Each Item in Part List: Check Quantity
|
|--> If Part Available: Reserve Part
|
|--> If Part Not Available: Back-Order Part
|
v
Engineering Department Prepares for Assembly
|
v
If All Parts Reserved or Back-Ordered and Preparation Finished: Assemble Bicycle
|
v
Sales Department Ships Bicycle
|
v
End Process
```

This BPMN model represents the process flow for the manufacturing of customized bicycles in the described company. It starts with the sales department receiving an order and ends with the bicycle being shipped to the customer. The process includes decision points, tasks performed by different departments, and a loop for processing each item in the part list. Please note that this is a simplified representation and actual BPMN diagrams would include more details and visual elements.
