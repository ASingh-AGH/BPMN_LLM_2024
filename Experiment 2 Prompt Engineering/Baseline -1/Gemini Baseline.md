## Prompt 

    I want you to create a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) model for the process described below. 

    Process description: A small company manufactures customized bicycles. Whenever the sales department receives an order, a new process instance is created. A member of the sales 
    department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike. In the former case, the process instance is finished. In the latter case, the storehouse and the engineering department are 
    informed. The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part. If the part is available in-house, it is reserved. If it is not available, it is 
    back-ordered. This procedure is repeated for each item on the part list. In the meantime, the engineering department prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle. If the 
    storehouse successfully reserved or back-ordered every item of the part list and the preparation activity has finished, the engineering department assembles the bicycle. Afterwards, the sales 
    department ships the bicycle to the customer and nishes the process instance

## Response
## BPMN Model for Customized Bicycle Manufacturing

This BPMN model represents the process for manufacturing customized bicycles:

**Start Event:** Order Received (Customer places an order)

**Tasks:**

* **Sales_Review_Order:** Sales reviews the order details.
* **Sales_Reject_Order (Exclusive Gateway):** Decides whether to accept or reject the order.
* **Sales_Accept_Order:** Order is accepted.
* **Inform_Storehouse:** Sales informs the storehouse about the order.
* **Inform_Engineering:** Sales informs the engineering department about the order.
* **Process_Part_List:** Storehouse processes the part list.
* **Check_Part_Availability:** Storehouse checks availability for each part on the list.
  * **Yes (Sequence Flow):** Part is available.
  * **No (Sequence Flow):** Part is not available.
* **Reserve_Part:** Storehouse reserves the available part.
* **Backorder_Part:** Storehouse creates a backorder for the unavailable part.
* **Prepare_Assembly:** Engineering prepares for assembling the bicycle.
* **Assemble_Bicycle:** Engineering assembles the bicycle (only happens after all parts are reserved/backordered and preparation is done)
* **Ship_Bicycle:** Sales ships the completed bicycle to the customer.
* **Finish_Process:** Sales finalizes the process instance.

**End Event:** Process Finished (Bicycle is shipped)

**Gateways:**

* **Sales_Reject_Order (Exclusive Gateway):** Ensures only one path (accept or reject) is chosen based on the sales decision.

**Data Objects:**

* **Order:** Contains details of the customized bicycle.
* **Part List:** List of parts required for the bicycle.
* **Inventory:** Information about available parts in the storehouse.
* **Backorder List:** List of parts on backorder.

**Sequence Flows:**

* Connect activities in the expected order of execution.
