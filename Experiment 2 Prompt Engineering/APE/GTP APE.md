## Prompt 

    I want you to create a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) model for the process described below. Return the model in the following format: task nodes as Task [words], parallel gateways as AND, exclusive gateways as XOR, and arcs as ->.
    You should number the gateways. 
    You may also label the outgoing arcs of an exclusive gateway to denote the decision criterion, like XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (action choice). 
    Additionally, provide a mapping of actors to activities, in the format Actor: [activity1, ...]

    Process description: A small company manufactures customized bicycles. Whenever the sales department receives an order, a new process instance is created. A member of the sales  department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike. In the former case, the process instance is nished. In the latter case, the storehouse and the engineering department are informed. The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part. If the part is available in- hause, it is reserved. If it is not available, it is back-ordered. This procedure is repeated for each item on the part list. In the meantime, the engineering department prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle. If the storehouse successfully reserved or back-ordered every item of the part list and the preparation activity has nished, the engineering department assembles the bicycle. Afterwards, the sales department ships the bicycle to the customer and nishes the process instance

    Letâ€™s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer.

## Response
Sure, let's break down the process step by step:

1. **Sales Department Receives Order**: 
   - Actor: Sales Department

2. **Accept or Reject Order**:
   - Actor: Sales Department

3. **If Order is Rejected**:
   - End Process Instance

4. **If Order is Accepted**:
   - Notify Storehouse and Engineering Department

5. **Storehouse Process Part List**:
   - Actor: Storehouse

6. **Check Part Availability**:
   - Actor: Storehouse

7. **If Part Available**:
   - Reserve Part

8. **If Part Not Available**:
   - Back-Order Part

9. **Repeat for Each Part in the List**

10. **Engineering Department Prepares for Assembly**:
    - Actor: Engineering Department

11. **If Part Reservation and Preparation Complete**:
    - Assemble Bicycle

12. **Ship Bicycle to Customer**:
    - Actor: Sales Department

Here's the BPMN model:

```
Sales Department -> Accept or Reject Order -> [Reject Order] -> End Process Instance
                  Accept or Reject Order -> [Accept Order] AND1 -> Notify Storehouse and Engineering Department
                  
AND1 -> Storehouse Process Part List -> Check Part Availability -> [Part Available] XOR1 -> Reserve Part -> XOR2
                                      Check Part Availability -> [Part Not Available] XOR1 -> Back-Order Part -> XOR2
                                      Check Part Availability -> [Part Not Available] XOR1 -> Back-Order Part -> XOR2
                                      Check Part Availability -> [Part Available] XOR1 -> Reserve Part -> XOR2
                                      ...

XOR2 -> Engineering Department Prepares for Assembly -> [Preparation Complete] -> Assemble Bicycle -> Ship Bicycle to Customer -> End Process Instance
```

Explanation of the model:

- **AND1**: Parallel gateway indicating that both the storehouse and the engineering department are notified simultaneously.
- **XOR1**: Exclusive gateway where the decision is made based on part availability.
- **XOR2**: Exclusive gateway where the decision is made based on whether part reservation and preparation are complete.
