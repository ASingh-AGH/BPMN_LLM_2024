## Prompt 

    I want you to create a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) model for the process described below. Return the model in the following format: task nodes as Task [words], parallel gateways as AND, exclusive gateways as XOR, and arcs as ->.
    You should number the gateways. 
    You may also label the outgoing arcs of an exclusive gateway to denote the decision criterion, like XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (action choice). 
    Additionally, provide a mapping of actors to activities, in the format Actor: [activity1, ...]

    Process description: A small company manufactures customized bicycles. Whenever the sales department receives an order, a new process instance is created. A member of the sales  department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike. In the former case, the process instance is finished. In the latter case, the storehouse and the engineering department are informed. The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part. If the part is available in-house, it is reserved. If it is not available, it is back-ordered. This procedure is repeated for each item on the part list. In the meantime, the engineering department prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle. If the storehouse successfully reserved or back-ordered every item of the part list and the preparation activity has finished, the engineering department assembles the bicycle. Afterwards, the sales department ships the bicycle to the customer and nishes the process instance

    Hint: A good example of formatting is as follows:
    Start Event O -> Task [Describe Task]
    Task [Describe Task] -> XOR Gateway 1
    XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (Describe Condition 1)
    XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (Describe Condition 2)
    Condition (Describe Condition 1) -> Task [Describe Task]
    Condition (Describe Condition 2) -> Event End O

    Hint: Another good example of formatting is as follows:
    Start Event O -> Task [Receives an Order]
    Task [Receives an Order] -> XOR Gateway 1
    XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (Order Rejected)
    XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (Order Accepted)
    Condition (Order Rejected) -> Event End O
    Condition (Order Accepted) -> Task [Inform Storehouse and Engineering Department]
    
    Letâ€™s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Firstly, think logically for a well-defined workflow, avoiding common modeling issues like deadlocks and unconnected broken flows.

## Response
## BPMN Model for Customized Bicycle Manufacturing

**Start Event (O) -> Task [Receive Order]**
**Task [Receive Order]** -> **XOR Gateway 1**
**XOR Gateway 1** -> **Condition (Order Rejected)**
**Condition (Order Rejected)** -> **Event End (O)**
**XOR Gateway 1** -> **Condition (Order Accepted)**
**Condition (Order Accepted)** -> **Task [Inform Storehouse and Engineering Department]**
**Task [Inform Storehouse and Engineering Department]** -> **Parallel Gateway (AND)**
**Parallel Gateway (AND)** -> **Task [Process Part List (Storehouse)]**
**Task [Process Part List (Storehouse)]** -> **Exclusive Gateway 2**
**Exclusive Gateway 2** -> **Condition (Part Available)**
**Condition (Part Available)** -> **Task [Reserve Part (Storehouse)]**
**Condition (Part Available - No)** -> **Task [Backorder Part (Storehouse)]**
**Task [Reserve Part (Storehouse)]** or **Task [Backorder Part (Storehouse)]** -> **Loop Gateway** (looping back to **Task [Process Part List (Storehouse)]**)
**Loop Gateway** (looping condition: All parts processed) -> **Task [Preparation for Assembly (Engineering)]**
**Parallel Gateway (AND)** -> **Task [Preparation for Assembly (Engineering)]**
**Task [Preparation for Assembly (Engineering)]** -> **Exclusive Gateway 3**
**Exclusive Gateway 3** -> **Condition (All Parts Available)** (combined check from Storehouse)
**Condition (All Parts Available - No)** -> **Event End (O)** (Process Halted)
**Condition (All Parts Available - Yes)** -> **Task [Assemble Bicycle (Engineering)]**
**Task [Assemble Bicycle (Engineering)]** -> **Task [Ship Bicycle (Sales)]**
**Task [Ship Bicycle (Sales)]** -> **Event End (O)**

**Actor Mapping:**

* Sales Department: [Receive Order, Inform Storehouse and Engineering Department, Ship Bicycle]
* Storehouse: [Process Part List, Reserve Part, Backorder Part]
* Engineering Department: [Preparation for Assembly, Assemble Bicycle]
