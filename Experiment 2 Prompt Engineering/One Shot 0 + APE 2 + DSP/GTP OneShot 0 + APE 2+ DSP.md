## Prompt 

    I want you to create a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) model for the process described below. Return the model in the following format: task nodes as Task [words], parallel gateways as AND, exclusive gateways as XOR, and arcs as ->.
    You should number the gateways. 
    You may also label the outgoing arcs of an exclusive gateway to denote the decision criterion, like XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (action choice). 
    Additionally, provide a mapping of actors to activities, in the format Actor: [activity1, ...]

    Process description: A small company manufactures customized bicycles. Whenever the sales department receives an order, a new process instance is created. A member of the sales  department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike. In the former case, the process instance is finished. In the latter case, the storehouse and the engineering department are informed. The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part. If the part is available in-house, it is reserved. If it is not available, it is back-ordered. This procedure is repeated for each item on the part list. In the meantime, the engineering department prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle. If the storehouse successfully reserved or back-ordered every item of the part list and the preparation activity has finished, the engineering department assembles the bicycle. Afterwards, the sales department ships the bicycle to the customer and nishes the process instance

    Hint: A good example of formatting is as follows:
    Start Event O -> Task [Describe Task]
    Task [Describe Task] -> XOR Gateway 1
    XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (Describe Condition 1)
    XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (Describe Condition 2)
    Condition (Describe Condition 1) -> Task [Describe Task]
    Condition (Describe Condition 2) -> Event End O

    Letâ€™s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Firstly, think logically for a well-defined workflow, avoiding common modeling issues like deadlocks and unconnected broken flows.

## Response
Sure, let's break down the process into a BPMN model step by step:

1. **Start Event:** Whenever the sales department receives an order, a new process instance is created.
   ```
   Start Event O -> Task [Receive Order]
   ```

2. **Decision Point 1:** A member of the sales department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike.
   ```
   Task [Receive Order] -> XOR Gateway 1
   ```

3. **Accept Order Path:** If the order is accepted, the storehouse and the engineering department are informed.
   ```
   XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (Order Accepted)
   ```

4. **Storehouse Processing:** The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part.
   ```
   Condition (Order Accepted) -> Task [Process Part List]
   ```

5. **Decision Point 2:** For each item on the part list, check if the part is available in-house or needs to be back-ordered.
   ```
   Task [Process Part List] -> XOR Gateway 2
   ```

6. **Part Availability Check:** If the part is available in-house, it is reserved.
   ```
   XOR Gateway 2 -> Condition (Part Available)
   ```

7. **Back-Order:** If the part is not available, it is back-ordered.
   ```
   XOR Gateway 2 -> Condition (Part Not Available)
   ```

8. **Reservation/Back-Order Loop:** This procedure is repeated for each item on the part list.
   ```
   Condition (Part Available) -> Task [Reserve Part]
   Task [Reserve Part] -> XOR Gateway 2
   Condition (Part Not Available) -> Task [Back-Order Part]
   Task [Back-Order Part] -> XOR Gateway 2
   ```

9. **Engineering Preparation:** Meanwhile, the engineering department prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle.
   ```
   Condition (Order Accepted) -> Task [Engineering Preparation]
   ```

10. **Check Completion:** If the storehouse successfully reserved or back-ordered every item of the part list and the preparation activity has finished.
   ```
   Task [Engineering Preparation] AND Task [Reserve Part] -> AND Gateway 1
   ```

11. **Bicycle Assembly:** The engineering department assembles the bicycle.
   ```
   AND Gateway 1 -> Task [Assemble Bicycle]
   ```

12. **Shipping:** Afterwards, the sales department ships the bicycle to the customer and finishes the process instance.
   ```
   Task [Assemble Bicycle] -> Task [Ship Bicycle]
   Task [Ship Bicycle] -> End Event O
   ```

Mapping of Actors to Activities:
- Sales Department: [Receive Order]
- Storehouse: [Process Part List, Reserve Part, Back-Order Part]
- Engineering Department: [Engineering Preparation, Assemble Bicycle]
- Sales Department (for Shipping): [Ship Bicycle]
