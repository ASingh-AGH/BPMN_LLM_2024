## Prompt 

    I want you to create a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) model for the process described below. Return the model in the following format: task nodes as Task [words], parallel gateways as AND, exclusive gateways as XOR, and arcs as ->.
    You should number the gateways. 
    You may also label the outgoing arcs of an exclusive gateway to denote the decision criterion, like XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (action choice). 
    Additionally, provide a mapping of actors to activities, in the format Actor: [activity1, ...]

    Process description: A small company manufactures customized bicycles. Whenever the sales department receives an order, a new process instance is created. A member of the sales  department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike. In the former case, the process instance is finished. In the latter case, the storehouse and the engineering department are informed. The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part. If the part is available in-house, it is reserved. If it is not available, it is back-ordered. This procedure is repeated for each item on the part list. In the meantime, the engineering department prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle. If the storehouse successfully reserved or back-ordered every item of the part list and the preparation activity has finished, the engineering department assembles the bicycle. Afterwards, the sales department ships the bicycle to the customer and nishes the process instance

    Hint: A good example of formatting is as follows:
    Start Event O -> Task [Describe Task]
    Task [Describe Task] -> XOR Gateway 1
    XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (Describe Condition 1)
    XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (Describe Condition 2)
    Condition (Describe Condition 1) -> Task [Describe Task]
    Condition (Describe Condition 2) -> Event End O

    Letâ€™s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Firstly, think logically for a well-defined workflow, avoiding common modeling issues like deadlocks and unconnected broken flows.

## Response
## BPMN Model for Customized Bicycle Manufacturing

**Start Event -> Task [Receive Order]**
**Task [Receive Order]** -> **XOR Gateway 1**
**XOR Gateway 1** -> **Condition (Reject Order?)** -> **Task [Reject Order]** (End Event)
**XOR Gateway 1** -> **Condition (Accept Order?)** -> **Task [Inform Storehouse]**
**Task [Inform Storehouse]** ->** Task [Process Part List]**
**Task [Process Part List]** -> **Exclusive Gateway 2**
**Exclusive Gateway 2** -> **Condition (Part Available?)** -> **Task [Reserve Part]**
**Exclusive Gateway 2** -> **Condition (Part Available?)** (No) -> **Task [Backorder Part]**
**Task [Reserve Part]**  / **Task [Backorder Part]**  -> **Loop Gateway**
**Loop Gateway** -> **Condition (More Parts?)** (Yes) -> **Task [Process Part List]**
**Loop Gateway** (No) -> **Task [Inform Engineering]** (Wait State)
**Task [Receive Order]** (Start) -> **Task [Prepare Assembly]** (Wait State)
**Wait State (Storehouse)** -> **XOR Gateway 3**
**Wait State (Engineering)** -> **XOR Gateway 3**
**XOR Gateway 3** -> **Condition (All Parts Reserved/Backordered?)** (Yes) & **Condition (Assembly Preparation Finished?)** (Yes) -> **Task [Assemble Bicycle]**
**Task [Assemble Bicycle]** -> **Task [Ship Bicycle]** -> **End Event**

**Actors:**

* Sales Department: Receive Order, Reject Order (if applicable), Inform Storehouse, Ship Bicycle
* Storehouse: Process Part List, Reserve Part, Backorder Part
* Engineering Department: Prepare Assembly, Assemble Bicycle

This model incorporates the following improvements based on the identified issues in traditional flowcharts:

* **Deadlock Prevention:** The loop gateway with "More Parts?" condition ensures the process doesn't get stuck in the storehouse tasks.
* **Unconnected Flows:** All paths lead to an end event, avoiding unconnected branches.
* **Wait States:** The wait states for Storehouse and Engineering tasks synchronize their completion before assembly.

This BPMN model provides a clear visual representation of the customized bicycle manufacturing process, ensuring efficient communication and avoiding workflow pitfalls.
