## Prompt 

    I want you to create a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) model for the process described below. Return the model in the following format: task nodes as Task [words], parallel gateways as AND, exclusive gateways as XOR, and arcs as ->.
    You should number the gateways. 
    You may also label the outgoing arcs of an exclusive gateway to denote the decision criterion, like XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (action choice). 
    Additionally, provide a mapping of actors to activities, in the format Actor: [activity1, ...]

    Process description: A small company manufactures customized bicycles. Whenever the sales department receives an order, a new process instance is created. A member of the sales  department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike. In the former case, the process instance is finished. In the latter case, the storehouse and the engineering department are informed. The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part. If the part is available in-house, it is reserved. If it is not available, it is back-ordered. This procedure is repeated for each item on the part list. In the meantime, the engineering department prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle. If the storehouse successfully reserved or back-ordered every item of the part list and the preparation activity has finished, the engineering department assembles the bicycle. Afterwards, the sales department ships the bicycle to the customer and nishes the process instance

    A good example of formatting is as follows,
    Start Event O -> Task [Receives an Order]
    Task [Receives an Order] -> XOR Gateway 1
    XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (Order Rejected)
    XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (Order Accepted)
    Condition (Order Rejected) -> Event End O
    Condition (Order Accepted) -> Task [Inform Storehouse and Engineering Department]


## Response
Here is the BPMN model for the process:

```
Start Event O -> Task [Sales Department Receives an Order]
Task [Sales Department Receives an Order] -> XOR Gateway 1
XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (Order Rejected)
XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (Order Accepted)
Condition (Order Rejected) -> Event End O
Condition (Order Accepted) -> AND Gateway 1
AND Gateway 1 -> Task [Storehouse Processes Part List]
AND Gateway 1 -> Task [Engineering Department Prepares for Assembling]
Task [Storehouse Processes Part List] -> XOR Gateway 2
XOR Gateway 2 -> Condition (Part Available)
XOR Gateway 2 -> Condition (Part Not Available)
Condition (Part Available) -> Task [Part Reserved]
Condition (Part Not Available) -> Task [Part Back-Ordered]
Task [Part Reserved] -> AND Gateway 2
Task [Part Back-Ordered] -> AND Gateway 2
Task [Engineering Department Prepares for Assembling] -> AND Gateway 2
AND Gateway 2 -> Task [Engineering Department Assembles Bicycle]
Task [Engineering Department Assembles Bicycle] -> Task [Sales Department Ships Bicycle]
Task [Sales Department Ships Bicycle] -> Event End O
```

And here is the mapping of actors to activities:

- Sales Department: [Receives an Order, Ships Bicycle]
- Storehouse: [Processes Part List, Part Reserved, Part Back-Ordered]
- Engineering Department: [Prepares for Assembling, Assembles Bicycle]
