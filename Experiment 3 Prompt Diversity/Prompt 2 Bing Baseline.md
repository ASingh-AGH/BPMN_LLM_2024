# Bing Prompt 2

## Prompt 

    I want you to create a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) model for the process described below. Return the model in the following format: task nodes as Task [words], parallel gateways as AND, exclusive gateways as XOR, and arcs as ->.
    You should number the gateways. 
    You may also label the outgoing arcs of an exclusive gateway to denote the decision criterion, like XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (action choice). 
    Additionally, provide a mapping of actors to activities, in the format Actor: [activity1, ...]

    A customer brings in a defective computer and the CRS checks the defect and hands out a repair cost calculation back. If the customer decides that the costs are acceptable, the process continues, otherwise she takes her computer home unrepaired. The ongoing repair consists of two activities, which are executed, in an arbitrary order. The rst activity is to check and repair the hardware, whereas the second activity checks and con gures the software. After each of these activities, the proper system functionality is tested. If an error is detected another arbitrary repair activity is executed, otherwise the repair isfinished.


## Response
Here is the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) model for the described process:

```
Task [Customer brings in a defective computer] -> 
Task [CRS checks the defect] -> 
Task [CRS hands out a repair cost calculation] -> 
XOR Gateway 1 -> 
    Condition (Costs are acceptable) -> 
        AND Gateway 1 -> 
            Task [Check and repair the hardware] -> 
            Task [Check and configure the software] -> 
        AND Gateway 1 -> 
        XOR Gateway 2 -> 
            Condition (Error detected) -> 
                Task [Execute arbitrary repair activity] -> 
            XOR Gateway 2
    Condition (Costs are not acceptable) -> 
        Task [Customer takes her computer home unrepaired]
```

And here is the mapping of actors to activities:

- Customer: [brings in a defective computer, decides if costs are acceptable, takes her computer home unrepaired]
- CRS: [checks the defect, hands out a repair cost calculation, checks and repairs the hardware, checks and configures the software, executes arbitrary repair activity if an error is detected]
