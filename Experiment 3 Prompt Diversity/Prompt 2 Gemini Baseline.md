# Gemini Prompt 2

## Prompt 

    I want you to create a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) model for the process described below. Return the model in the following format: task nodes as Task [words], parallel gateways as AND, exclusive gateways as XOR, and arcs as ->.
    You should number the gateways. 
    You may also label the outgoing arcs of an exclusive gateway to denote the decision criterion, like XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (action choice). 
    Additionally, provide a mapping of actors to activities, in the format Actor: [activity1, ...]

    A customer brings in a defective computer and the CRS checks the defect and hands out a repair cost calculation back. If the customer decides that the costs are acceptable, the process continues, otherwise she takes her computer home unrepaired. The ongoing repair consists of two activities, which are executed, in an arbitrary order. The rst activity is to check and repair the hardware, whereas the second activity checks and con gures the software. After each of these activities, the proper system functionality is tested. If an error is detected another arbitrary repair activity is executed, otherwise the repair isfinished.


## Response
## BPMN Model

```
Customer Brings Defective Computer -> Start Event 1
Start Event 1 -> CRS Checks Defect [Task 1]
Task 1 -> XOR Gateway 1
XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (Acceptable Cost) -> Repair Cost Calculation [Task 2]
XOR Gateway 1 -> Customer Takes Computer Home [End Event 2]
Task 2 -> AND Gateway 3
AND Gateway 3 -> Hardware Check & Repair [Task 4]
AND Gateway 3 -> Software Check & Configure [Task 5]
Task 4 -> System Functionality Test [Task 6]
Task 5 -> System Functionality Test [Task 6]
Task 6 -> XOR Gateway 2
XOR Gateway 2 -> Error Detected -> Arbitrary Repair [Task 7]
XOR Gateway 2 -> Repair Finished -> Repair Cost Payment [Task 8] -> End Event 3
Task 7 -> System Functionality Test [Task 6]
```

## Actor Mapping

* Customer: Brings Defective Computer, Customer Takes Computer Home (if cost not acceptable)
* CRS: CRS Checks Defect, Repair Cost Calculation
* Technician: Hardware Check & Repair, Software Check & Configure, Arbitrary Repair (if error detected)
