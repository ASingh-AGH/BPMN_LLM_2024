# Gemini Prompt 2

## Prompt 

    I want you to create a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) model for the process described below. Return the model in the following format: task nodes as Task [words], parallel gateways as AND, exclusive gateways as XOR, and arcs as ->.
    You should number the gateways. 
    You may also label the outgoing arcs of an exclusive gateway to denote the decision criterion, like XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (action choice). 
    Additionally, provide a mapping of actors to activities, in the format Actor: [activity1, ...]

    A customer brings in a defective computer and the CRS checks the defect and hands out a repair cost calculation back. If the customer decides that the costs are acceptable, the process continues, otherwise she takes her computer home unrepaired. The ongoing repair consists of two activities, which are executed, in an arbitrary order. The rst activity is to check and repair the hardware, whereas the second activity checks and con gures the software. After each of these activities, the proper system functionality is tested. If an error is detected another arbitrary repair activity is executed, otherwise the repair isfinished.


## Response
Here's the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) model for the process you described:

```
Start Event -> CRS checks defect -> XOR Gateway 1
XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (Costs acceptable?) -> Repair Hardware [First activity]
XOR Gateway 1 -> Condition (Costs acceptable?) -> Customer takes computer home [End Event]

Repair Hardware -> Test Hardware functionality -> XOR Gateway 2
XOR Gateway 2 -> Condition (Hardware repair successful?) -> Repair Software [Second activity]
XOR Gateway 2 -> Condition (Hardware repair successful?) -> Customer takes computer home [End Event]

Repair Software -> Test Software functionality -> XOR Gateway 3
XOR Gateway 3 -> Condition (Software repair successful?) -> Repair Additional [Third activity]
XOR Gateway 3 -> Condition (Software repair successful?) -> Repair finished [End Event]

Repair Additional -> Test functionality -> Repair finished [End Event]
```

Actor to Activity Mapping:
- CRS: Checks defect, Hands out repair cost calculation
- Customer: Decides on repair costs, Takes computer home unrepaired
