# BPMN_LLM_2024
BPMN LLM Engineering Thesis 2024 Prompts and Outputs


# Experiment 1 Baseline

### Baseline BIKE
Prompt description with some direction on using an intermediate BPMN notation
    3 Diagrams


# Experiment 2 Prompt Engineering 

45 total prompts by 3 models of Two Shot + APE + DSP

    To note: all prompts were executed in a new chat- none of them are chained.
